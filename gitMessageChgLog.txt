Implemented new method of scrolling the game world:
- Changed objects.World to have a programmable setting to add a second instance of background for modified scroll method.
- Updated menu and Level 1 scenes to use new setting in objects.World.
			**Known Issue** seems to be a 2-3 pixel gap between first and second instance of world background objects.
			Attempted patch: Subtract 5 from new reset position to create overlap. Made no difference.
- Shifted player object down to ground level.
