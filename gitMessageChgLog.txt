Completed functionality on spikes, bug fixes, enhancements:  
- Fixed spike  
  - Stopped rendering at top of screen. Renders correctly at the world floor.
  - Corrected left to right motion.
  - Fixed issue where spikes rendered in the game scene instead of outside.
  **Known Issues** 
  - [ ] Spikes still seem slightly predictable. Minor. Fix later.

- Fixed Batarang collisions.
- Changed `_lives` from level-scope to game scope. Renamed to `lives`.  
  Allows for lives to carry over to the next screen. The better a player does in the level before, the better their chances of success are in the later levels.
